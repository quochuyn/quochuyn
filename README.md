### Hey there 👋

I'm pursuing a 🎓 master's degree in data science from University of Michigan and I have a bachelor's degree in mathematics from University of California, Irvine. I've got 8 months of industry experience and 1.5 years of research experience working on interdisciplinary teams, engineering data pipelines, performing data analysis, building models, and more!

My most recent projects:
  1. 🎥 **youtube_nlp_recommender** [Article](https://medium.com/@gabrielalon257/youtube-filtering-capstone-67f755fb6dca) | [Repo](https://github.com/quochuyn/youtube_nlp_recommender) | [Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10EIKd1QhmoLsq2TeQgsYkP51RMODiRMc/view) | [Website](https://youtube-capstone.streamlit.app/) This is an end-to-end product for a Youtube video recommender system with a NLP-based filter using LLMs like BERT and Chat-GPT to provide a personalized browsing experience and filter offensive/addictive content.
  2. 🏒 **nhl-draft-predictions** [Article](https://deepnote.com/@nhl-draft-predictions/NHL-Draft-Predictions-09d8dc5c-d54b-4729-bd12-f4067dd931f4) | [Repo](https://github.com/quochuyn/nhl-draft-predictions) We leveraged Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to predict player outcomes in the National Hockey League (NHL) draft. We outline our journey through various NLP methodologies, starting from the baseline NLTK approach and progressing to state-of-the-art Language Models (LLMs) like Google's BERT and OpenAI's Chat-GPT.
