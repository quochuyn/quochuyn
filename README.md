### Hey there 👋

I'm pursuing a 🎓 master's degree in data science from University of Michigan and I have a bachelor's degree in mathematics from University of California, Irvine. I've got 8 months of industry experience and 1.5 years of research experience working on interdisciplinary teams, engineering data pipelines, performing data analysis, building models, and more!

My most recent project:
  1. 🏒 In [nhl-draft-predctions](https://github.com/quochuyn/nhl-draft-predictions), we explored using NLP to analyze scouting reports for player prospects in the NHL. We tried the baseline NLTK approach and some state-of-the-art LLMs like Google's BERT and OpenAI's Chat-GPT models. Check out our [final paper here](https://deepnote.com/@nhl-draft-predictions/NHL-Draft-Predictions-09d8dc5c-d54b-4729-bd12-f4067dd931f4).
